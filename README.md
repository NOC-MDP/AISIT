## Case Study: Apply Machine Learning to Oxygen Isotope Tracer Data

We present a case study where a simple machine learning model is applied to in-situ oxygen isotope tracer data to produce a spatially-complete dataset in the Arctic region.

In-situ data is collated as part of the BIOPOLE project by the British Antarctic Survey.
